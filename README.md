This program was for the Edube Interactive Python course

I know there are some things I need to fix, as it doesn't do exactly what I want it to. 

It displays the board more than I would like and I need to fine tune the code a bit, but overall, happy I got it done! 

This took me around 3-4 hours, and then took a couple hours out of a weekend to simplify it and make sure it works.
